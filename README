Running declarative nixos in a terminal using qemu.

**Running**
Simply run `./build-run.sh` on a system with nix installed.

**File listing**
* `build-run.sh` -- run this to start the vm
* `configuration.nix` -- declarative nixos (applications, etc.)

**Configuring things**
See https://search.nixos.org for packages and options that
can be set in `configuration.nix`.

**Starting over**
State is persisted via nixos.qcow2, which is created after
running build-run.sh. Delete nixos.qcow2 to regenerate from
`configuration.nix`.

**Understanding more about how this works**
Inspect `build-run.sh` and the files created in `result/`.

**Killing the process**

  $ pkill qemu
